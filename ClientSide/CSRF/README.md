### What is a CSRF.

Cross-Site Request Forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the user to perform unintended actions.

In order to meet the CSRF in a website, there has to be at least 3 conditions:

- Predictable request parameters.
- Sesion handling based on cookies.
- A relevant action.
